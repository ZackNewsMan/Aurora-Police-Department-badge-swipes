# Aurora-Police-Department-badge-swipes

Findings:
9Wants to Know has learned that on average, Aurora Police Department senior leadership is in the office about half of the time.  Chief Vanessa Wilson swiped in 42% of the 159 possible work days from January 1, 2021 to August 18, 2021.  Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen was in the office 80 more days than Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson was. Pazen swiped in 92% of available days, while Wilson was there 42% of the time. That translates to Pazen being present for 146 days while Wilson was there for 66 of them.

Data diary:
9Wants to Know analyzed municipal badge data to see how often the leadership team came into an Aurora city building. 9NEWS sought records across a longer period of time. But - Lisa Horton, Aurora's municipal records supervisor, wrote in an email that the city of Aurora only keeps 180 days of data at a time before deleting it. 9Wants to Know made these calculations off of the assumption weekends and holidays weren't included as days they could come into the office, although it is possible they did so. It's unclear if they worked from home during this time period as well. 

The "Original" folder will contain the data as it was sent to me by the city of Aurora. 

The R code was what was used to clean the data. 

The finished analysis for each person was placed within a tab in the "Master Swipes" Excel sheet. I will also put each individual's finished analysis in the "Finished" folder.
