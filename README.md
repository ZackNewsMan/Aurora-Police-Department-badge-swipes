# Aurora-Police-Department-badge-swipes

Findings:
9Wants to Know has learned that chief Vanessa Wilson swiped in 42% of the 159 possible work days from January 23, 2021 to August 18, 2021.  Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen was in the office 80 more days than Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson was. Pazen swiped in 91% of available days, while Wilson was there 51% of the time. That translates to Pazen being present for 131 days while Wilson was there for 74 of them.

Data diary:
9Wants to Know analyzed municipal badge data to see how often the leadership team came into an Aurora city building. 9NEWS sought records across a longer period of time. But - Lisa Horton, Aurora's municipal records supervisor, wrote in an email that the city of Aurora only keeps 180 days of data at a time before deleting it. We calculated the attendance for the rest of APD's senior leadership but decided not to move forward with the findings because Ryan Luby, spokesperson for the Aurora City Attorney, said in a phone call the the 180-day retention schedule means that swipe data is continuously deleted. Therefore, it would be difficult to pull the same data for the same period of time for everyone and be confident in the data's accuracy.

9Wants to Know made these calculations off of the assumption weekends and holidays weren't included as days they could come into the office, although it is possible they did so. It's unclear if they worked from home during this time period as well. 

The "Original" folder will contain the data as it was sent to me by the city of Aurora. 

The R code was what was used to clean the data.
